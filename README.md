Four-Function Calculator
===================

By Thomas Tran

## Longer Description
This project involves designing and implementing a Four-Function Calculator on the DE2-115 FPGA board. The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—on 11-bit two’s complement integers and displays the results on 7-segment HEX displays.

The lab showcases Register Transfer Level (RTL) design, and although the design appears simple, it provides insights into creating a datapath and controller for sequential digital systems.
